# Prework Study Guide Webpage
 
## Description
 
This project was an introduction to help me understand how HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript work together with each other.
 
This was motivated by my desire to learn more coding fundamentals in a formal atmosphere to improve my coding to a level that is employable.
 
Doing this project helped introduce me in a methodical way how some of the various languages and functionalities work together. As well as build a solid foundation for me to work on going forward.
 
It solved the task of keeping all my notes in a local storage now allowing for me and others to reference the pages when needed. It also could serve as a primarily presentation to new students about what they will be working towards before the class starts.
 
I learned how to set up a basic HTML file and was introduced to some topics but know there are far more to learn. This applies to CSS as well so that the HTML page isn't as bulky or responsive to small changes in the CSS or HTML. Then JavaScript was introduced with the developer tools in the browser to help with debugging web pages. Then Finally thru all of this I used Git to develop an understanding and get in a good habit of commit-ting and when to push a branch.
